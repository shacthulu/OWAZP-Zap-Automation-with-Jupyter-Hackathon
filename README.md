# OWASP ZAP Automation UI Using Jupyter Notebooks

## Overview

This project was created as part of a hackathon to develop a user-friendly automation interface for OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy). The goal was to simplify the process of running security scans using ZAP, making it more accessible to users who may not be familiar with the tool's intricacies. Jupyter notebooks allowed for rapid creation, iteration, and accessibility for both technical and non-technical users.

## Features

- Interactive UI for configuring and running ZAP scans
- Step-by-step guidance through the scanning process
- Support for both traditional and AJAX spider scans
- Multiple pre-configured scan profiles (Cautious, Methodical, Intense, Automatic, Log4j Detection)
- Progress tracking for scans
- Basic reporting functionality

## Technology

The project is implemented as a Jupyter notebook, utilizing:

- Python
- OWASP ZAP API
- ipywidgets for interactive elements
- HTML/Markdown for documentation and instructions

## Status

This project is now archived and no longer maintained. It was created as a proof of concept during a hackathon and is not intended for production use.
